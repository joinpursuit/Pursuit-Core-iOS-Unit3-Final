## Objective

* Build a table view that loads and displays a list of the Elements, one per cell/row. Use a custom UITableViewCell subclass.  It should have 2 labels and one image.  The image should be pinned to the left of cell from the small images endpoint below.  The labels should be configured as below:

    ```
    Name
    Symbol(Number) Atomic Weight

    e.g.

    Sodium
    Na(11) 22.989769282
    ```
    
    Load a thumbnail image on each row as described below under Endpoints > Images.  For full credit, use a custom tableViewCell to make the image more readable.
    
* Tapping a cell segues to a detail view that:
    * set the navigation bar title to the ```name``` of the element
    * shows the larger image 
    * and the following data:
        * symbol
        * number
        * weight
        * melting point
        * boiling point
        * discovery by

    * has a button that, when pressed, selects this element as your favorite. This
    should be implemented by a POST to the ```favorites``` endpoint.


Try to format the detail view as much like an individual element on a traditional periodic table as you can. You **cannot** use the thumbnail image inside the detail view controller, you need to format it yourself.

Sample element: [https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06-Carbon-Tile.png](https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06-Carbon-Tile.png)

## Endpoints

**Elements**

```
GET https://5c1d79abbc26950013fbcaa9.mockapi.io/api/v1/elements
```

This is a public read-only GET endpoint so no authentication is necessary.

**Images**

```
Thumbnail (for table view): http://www.theodoregray.com/periodictable/Tiles/{ElementIDWithThreeDigits}/s7.JPG
Example: 7777

Full-size: (for detail view): http://images-of-elements.com/{lowercasedElementName}.jpg
Example: http://images-of-elements.com/argon.jpg
```

Use the file naming convention illustrated here to generate urls for images.

These are both http urls, so you will need change your info.plist to [allow arbitrary loads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31254725/transport-security-has-blocked-a-cleartext-http).

No full size images are available for atomic numbers 90 and up.

**Favorites**

```
POST http://5c1d79abbc26950013fbcaa9.mockapi.io/api/v1/favorites
```

## Bonus 

Get all favorites endpoint
```
GET http://5c1d79abbc26950013fbcaa9.mockapi.io/api/v1/favorites
```

1. Embed your ElementsViewController in a Tab Bar controller that has 2 viewcontrollers that includes the ElementsViewController. The first view controller should display the Elements. The second view controller should display only the Elements you have favorited. (Hint: filter{} using favoritedBy: "Your name")

2. In the elements endpoint abover there are 100 elements. The periodic table has 118 elements. Using the following endpoint ```https://5c1d79abbc26950013fbcaa9.mockapi.io/api/v1/elements_remaining``` append the remaining 18 elements to your table vie of elements.

3. Add Unit test(s).
